# Prediction and Uncertainty Quantification of Drought in North Benin

## 📌 Objective

This work aims to develop an **uncertainty-aware drought forecasting framework** for six key localities in the Alibori department of North Benin — **Banikoara, Gogounou, Kandi, Karimama, Malanville, and Segbana**.
Our goal is twofold:

1. **Predict drought conditions** using state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning models based on the Standardized Precipitation Index at a 6-month scale (SPI-6).
2. **Quantify prediction uncertainty** using the Ensemble Batch Prediction Interval (EnbPI) method, enabling more informed and trustworthy decision-making.

cd Drought-Forecasting-Benin/models
```

---

### 3️⃣ Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🚀 Running Experiments

### ▶ Run for a specific city (example: Banikoara)

```bash
python banikoara_generic_model_building.py
```

---

### ▶ Run for all six cities at once

```bash
chmod +x run_all.sh
./run_all.sh
```

## 📊 Results Overview

Our comparative study involved:

* **6 Machine Learning models**: Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, SVR
* **4 Deep Learning models**: Conv1D, LSTM, GRU, Conv1D-LSTM
* **Evaluation metrics**: R², RMSE, MAE, Carbon Footprint
* **Uncertainty metrics**: Empirical Coverage, Prediction Interval Width

The **Conv1D-LSTM** model emerged as the top performer, offering an optimal balance between predictive accuracy and uncertainty coverage.
